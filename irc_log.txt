Chiru	sorry was a bit late, what else do we need to do to get started with this training?
Greg	are the slides available to download?
Sachin R.	+1
where we can see presentation
Tim B.	Chiru: You should have Git installed and a command prompt. Matthew's talking about that now.
Greg: better than download; they're actually online in native form. We'll send you links at the end of class.
matthewmccullough	http://github.com/signup/free
Tim B.	Sachin: Can you see the screen Matthew is sharing? Just watch that for now, and we'll share slides later.
Greg	ok, thanks
Sachin R.	Tim : Thnx
Gaurav M.	Ok. I got the online account, do we need to have something installed on the laptop too ?
8:10 AM
Tim B.	Gaurav: Yes, you should have Git installed.
Do what Matthew is showing you right now, and let me know if it works.
Edgar W.	View paste

tarun	i have 1.8.0.2
Tim B.	tarun: Like a boss. Keep going.
Gaurav M.	Thanks Tim, I got it
Tim B.	naveen: Let's move forward with that. You might hit a speedbump later on, but just ask if anything happens and we'll figure it out then.
8:15 AM
i_yahoo	i just followed the commands on my machine
and i don't see the .git
stanleyhlng	need to show the hidden file i guess
Tim B.	i_yahoo: type "pwd" and paste in what it tells you.
stanleyhing: If you're looking in Windows Explorer, then yes. Otherwise, at Git Bash or a Mac Terminal window, you can type "ls -a" and see the .git folder.
i_yahoo	got it, thanks
Tim B.	i_yahoo: Win.
Sachin R.	Tim , is there any way i have the list of command used by presenter , along with chat window
Tim B.	Sachin: Not directly, but every once in a while I'll ask him to run the "history" command, so you can see that.
Sachin R.	ok
thanks
vishvesh	are git commit atomic?
8:20 AM
Hang S.	has entered the room
Edgar W.	ls -la to see the .git
Tim B.	vishvesh: Yes!
vishvesh: And remember, this commit is entirely local right now. This is just happening on disk, on your local box. We'll talk to the network later (and those operations will be atomic as well).
vishvesh	k.. thanks
Gaurav M.	What is this message:
View paste 
[magaurav@heightask-dr project1]$ git commit -m"Initial import"
[master (root-commit) 4daa879] Initial import
 Committer: Gaurav Maheshwari <magaurav@heightask-dr.eglbp.corp.yahoo.com>
Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
Sachin R.	what are "create mode 100644" ?
Tim B.	Garurav: We'll configure those things in a minute. :)
vishvesh	and what is 5 insertions
Tim B.	vishvesh: That means you added five lines to the file.
Gaurav M.	sure, thanks Tim.
vishvesh	oh..k..
Jacob	What's that historytailzsh thing
Is that a special shell
8:25 AM
naveen	how to reset the author of the first.txt commit
after setting email and name
Tim B.	Jacob: Yeah, just some presentation magic. Matthew is using a terminal program called iTerm 2 on the Mac. It allows horizontal and vertical shell splitting.
naveen	?
Tim B.	naveen: That's a bit of an advanced question for now, but 'git commit --amend --reset-author -m "Initial commit"' should do it. :)
8:30 AM
Gaurav M.	Why use "--" for each flag vs. a single "-" ?
Tim B.	Gaurav: As a Unix idiom, -- precedes flags that are spelled out (--message) and - precedes flags that are a single character (-m).
Hang S.	git config --list returns empty..
Tim B.	Gaurav: So you will see a mix of both.
Gaurav M.	got it. thanks.
Tim B.	Hang: That's totally fine. Follow along right now, and you'll have some config in there soon enough. :)
Hang S.	cool.
8:35 AM
Greg	you would be a "Yahoo" not "Yahoo-er"
Scott K.	has entered the room
Hang S.	what are configs used for, if they are empty by default and work just fine?
stanleyhlng	can i unset the config?
matthewmccullough	View paste 
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@yahoo.com"
Tim B.	Hang: EVERYTHING! Lots of things work by default, but there's a huge amount of configurable behavior in Git.
Hang: And really, the config we're showing you now is essentially required. It "works" without it, but you really do want a user.name and user.email set.
Hang S.	I see. thanks, Tim.
Tim B.	Hang: You bet!
8:40 AM
stanleyhlng	git config --local --unset user.name , it works ;)
robby k.	has left the room
Ollie R.	has entered the room
8:45 AM
Tim B.	Ollie: Answer to your config question: no. Config is outside of the repo history.
Ollie R.	Thanks Tim
Tim B.	Ollie: My pleasure.

Welcome to the chat. You can see who's currently in the room by looking to the right. Say "Hello" to everyone by just typing in the box below and hitting return.

Doug A.	that makes sense
usually if there's even close to a 50% change to my perl or php, something else probably went wrong in the saving of the file
10:15 AM
Greg	when would you want to do a git reset without --hard as the mode?
Tim B.	Doug: Yup! If it's more like 5% or 10% across a refactor-y move, that's more like it.
Troy N.	git stage seems slightly less confusing than git add
Tim B.	Greg: We were using reset earlier (with no --hard) to unstage files.
Troy: You are not the first to suggest this. Alas, we don't make the rules. ;)
Troy N.	:-)
Greg	I guess I don't understand when you would want to use other modes for reset, such as --soft
Ollie R.	greg, you're not alone, reset options can be complicated
Tim B.	Greg: --soft is a rarely used mode. --mixed and --hard are much more common.
Greg: And nobody every types --mixed, since it's the default, but it's the way you unstage stuff, so it's a good one to know.
Greg: And --hard is *extremely* useful, although dangerous.
Edgar W.	And yet, "all" for git commit is lowercase a.
Greg	ok thanks. dangerous meaning you could blow away code that wasn't committed, right?
Tim B.	Edgar: There are only so many letters in the alphabet. Sometimes they collide. After a certain point, you'll stop looking for the word they stand for and just love them for what they are.
Edgar W.	Just sayin...
Tim B.	Edgar; I hear you. :)
10:20 AM
Tim B.	Greg: Yes. It's the one way you can lose data in Git. Modified files are blown away by reset --hard.
kenseb	has left the room
Ollie R.	what does it show if you mv file, then do status before add?
Edgar W.	Change delta computed on line by line basis, or byte stream delta?
10:25 AM
Edgar W.	He said "it" again!
Tim B.	:)
Edgar: Just line-by-line.
Edgar W.	Thanks.
Tim B.	Ollie: If you "git mv," it looks just like the "git add -A ..."
They do the same thing. You should use "git add -A" when some external tool has done the moving, like if you're a Java dev and you used Eclipse to move a bunch of classes from one package to another, or a PHP dev and you reorganized directories and changed a bunch of includes.
Ollie R.	thanks tim, so manually on the command line, git mv is generally better (less typing)
Tim B.	Ollie: Yes. If you're moving a single file at a time, git mv is the win.

Edgar W.	Does .gitignore need to include itself?
gully	i thought the link you spread earlier here named the file ./.gitignore_global ?
Edgar W.	View paste 
appleguess-lm /project1> cat > .gitignore
appleguess-lm /project1> git status
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	.gitignore
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
appleguess-lm /project1>
Ah...
Ollie R.	gully: that was my link, and the filename is arbitrary until it's put into the config
Tim B.	gully: I don't recall that, but I trust you! You can call the file anything you can. The restriction is that you name the file by setting the "core.excludesfile" config parameter to point to the file.
Ollie R.	here's the link again: https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files
Tim B.	Ollie: Ah, that's why I don't recall that. Thanks again fer the link. :)
10:45 AM
balaji	~<version>
is the number of versions to go back from now?
how do i go to an absolute version?
say to the 10th version of the master?
got it thanks
Tim B.	git help gitrevisions
10:50 AM
balaji	and i am assuming master is hte master branch
and i ont htink we have covered branches, yet
right?
matthewmccullough	git help gitrevisions
Chiru	does "git" stand for something?
Tim B.	balaji: Correct. "master" refers to the default branch, which we have not covered yet.
vivekh	And head is currently pointing to master ?
Tim B.	Chiru: Sort of. It's a British term that translates to "idiot" in American English. The man who named Git (Linus Torvalds) jokingly said that he named it after himself. :)
Chiru: Linux is also named for Linus. So he named his two major projects after himself.
Chiru	cool. thanks
Tim B.	vivekh: HEAD points to the commit you currently have checked out. You'll see it move around when we start branching.
vivekh: It points to master if you're "on" master. If you're in detached head state, it's going to point to a commit that doesn't have any other name.
10:55 AM
Greg	Can you push from the command line without doing anything on the web? Or is that setup required?
Tim B.	Greg: You need to create a repo to push to, so you *sort of* have to do the web work. There's a command called "hub" that lets you do that repo creation from the command line, though.
Doug A.	If it's not already in the plan, I'd like to know how to deal with fast-forwards
